export const message = /* md */`We cannot recreate the issue with the provided information. **Please add a reproduction in order for us to be able to investigate.**

### **Why was this issue marked with the \`needs-reproduction\` label?**

To be able to investigate, we need access to a reproduction to identify what triggered the issue. Please provide a link to either :

- a public GitHub repository
- a [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)
- a [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/).

To make sure the issue is resolved as quickly as possible, please make sure that the reproduction is as **minimal** as possible. This means that you should **remove unnecessary code, files, and dependencies** that do not contribute to the issue.

### **I added a link, why was it still marked?**

Ensure the link is pointing to a codebase that is accessible (e.g. not a private repository). "[example.com](http://example.com/)", "n/a", "will add later", etc. are not acceptable links -- we need to see a public codebase. See the above section for accepted links.

### **What happens if I don't provide a sufficient minimal reproduction?**

Issues with the \`needs-reproduction\` label that receives no meaningful activity (e.g. new comments with a reproduction link) will be closed by the maintainers and won't be looked at.

### **I did not open this issue, but it is relevant to me, what can I do to help?**

Anyone experiencing the same issue is welcome to provide a minimal reproduction following the above steps. Furthermore, you can upvote the issue using a reaction on the topmost comment.

- Please **do not** comment "I have the same issue" without repro steps
- Please **do not** comment un-helpful messages such as "+1" on an issue, use reactions on the first comment instead.

### **I think my reproduction is good enough, why aren't you looking into it quicker?**

We constantly monitor open issues for new comments.

However, sometimes we might miss one or two. We apologize, and kindly ask you to refrain from tagging core maintainers, as that will usually not result in increased priority.

Upvoting issues to show your interest will help us prioritize and address them as quickly as possible.

### **I have a minimal reproduction to contribute to a closed issue.**

If you have a minimal reproduction for a closed issue, please write a comment on the issue with a link to the reproduction.
We will review it and reopen the issue if it is sufficient.
